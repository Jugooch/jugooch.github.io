## Technical Implementation

The game logic is implemented using TypeScript for type safety and better code organization. Here's a glimpse of the core game logic:

```ts
interface Cell {
  isMine: boolean;
  isRevealed: boolean;
  isFlagged: boolean;
  adjacentMines: number;
}

class GameBoard {
  private grid: Cell[][];
  private mineCount: number;
  private size: number;

  constructor(size: number, difficulty: Difficulty) {
    this.size = size;
    this.mineCount = this.calculateMineCount(difficulty);
    this.grid = this.initializeGrid();
    this.placeMines();
    this.calculateAdjacentMines();
  }

  private initializeGrid(): Cell[][] {
    return Array(this.size).fill(null).map(() =>
      Array(this.size).fill(null).map(() => ({
        isMine: false,
        isRevealed: false,
        isFlagged: false,
        adjacentMines: 0
      }))
    );
  }

  private placeMines(): void {
    let minesPlaced = 0;
    while (minesPlaced < this.mineCount) {
      const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.size);
      const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.size);
      
      if (!this.grid[y][x].isMine) {
        this.grid[y][x].isMine = true;
        minesPlaced++;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
