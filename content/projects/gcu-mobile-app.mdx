# University Mobile Student Application

This Application is a redesign of Grand Canyon University's (GCU's) mobile student application. The point of this redesign was to condense the amount of applications that GCU students have to download. As of right now, students download upwards of 8 to 9 applications to do various GCU-related tasks; this app shrinks that down to 1.

## The Problem

Students faced several challenges with the existing system:
- Multiple apps taking up excessive device storage
- Poor user experience when switching between apps
- Fragmented access to university services
- Inconsistent interface designs across different apps

## The Solution

Our redesigned application addresses these issues by:
- Consolidating all essential functions into a single app
- Creating a unified, intuitive user interface
- Reducing device storage requirements
- Streamlining daily student tasks
- Providing cross-platform support through Flutter

## Technical Implementation

The application was built using:
- Flutter for cross-platform development
- Firebase for backend services
- Dart programming language
- Figma for UI/UX design
- Adobe Creative Cloud for asset creation

## Development Process

1. Conducted extensive UI/UX case study with current GCU students
2. Created detailed wireframes and prototypes in Figma
3. Implemented responsive design patterns
4. Performed thorough testing across multiple devices
5. Gathered and incorporated student feedback

## Impact

The new application significantly improves the student experience by:
- Reducing the number of required apps from 8-9 to just 1
- Improving accessibility to university services
- Enhancing overall user experience
- Decreasing device storage requirements
