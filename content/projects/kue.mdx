# Kue - Dating App

An exclusive mobile dating application focused on matching people based on their nerdy interests. Built with Flutter and Firebase, this cross-platform application provides a unique dating experience for individuals who share specific interests in gaming, anime, comics, and other nerd culture elements.

## Technical Overview

The application leverages several modern technologies:

- **Flutter Framework**: Used for cross-platform development, supporting both iOS and Android
- **Firebase Backend**: Provides real-time database capabilities and authentication
- **Dart Language**: Powers the application logic and API calls
- **Figma**: Used for UI/UX design and prototyping

## Key Features

### User Authentication & Profile Setup

- Detailed profile customization
- Interest selection and preference settings

### Matching System
- Interest-based matching algorithm
- Swipe interface for user interaction
- Parameter-based filtering system

### Messaging Platform
- Real-time chat functionality
- Match management
- Message notifications

## Development Process

The development followed a structured approach:

1. Initial Design Phase
   - User interface mockups in Figma
   - User flow mapping

## Technical Architecture

The application uses a clean architecture pattern:

```dart
// Example of the matching algorithm implementation
class MatchingService {
  Future<List<Profile>> findMatches(UserPreferences preferences) async {
    // Implementation details for matching logic
    return await FirebaseFirestore.instance
        .collection('users')
        .where('interests', arrayContainsAny: preferences.interests)
        .get()
        .then((snapshot) => snapshot.docs
            .map((doc) => Profile.fromFirestore(doc))
            .toList());
  }
}
```
