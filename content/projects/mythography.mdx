# Mythography Application Support Suite

At Mythography, we draw inspiration from powerful figures of myth, instilling their virtues into each of our tools to provide support and insight to modern developers. Our suite of application support tools combines ancient wisdom with modern technology to create powerful, user-friendly solutions.

## The Mythological Tools

### Argus - Application Monitoring
Named after the all-seeing giant of Greek mythology, Argus provides:
- Continuous application monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- System health checks
- Real-time alerting system

### Balor - Threat Detection
Inspired by the Celtic figure of perception:
- Advanced threat detection
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security audit tools
- Real-time threat response

### Briareus - Analytics Engine
Drawing from the hundred-handed giant:
- Comprehensive user analytics
- Multi-interface tracking
- Behavior pattern analysis
- Performance insights

### Fafnir - Data Security
Based on the Norse dragon of protection:
- Advanced encryption standards
- Secure data transit
- At-rest data protection
- Adaptive security protocols

## Technical Implementation

The suite is built using modern web technologies:

```javascript
// Example of Argus monitoring implementation
class ArgusMonitor {
  constructor(config) {
    this.metrics = new MetricsCollector();
    this.alerts = new AlertSystem();
    this.reporting = new ReportGenerator();
  }

  async monitor() {
    const metrics = await this.metrics.collect();
    const threshold = this.config.threshold;
    
    if (metrics.exceeds(threshold)) {
      await this.alerts.trigger({
        level: 'warning',
        message: 'Performance threshold exceeded',
        data: metrics
      });
    }
  }
}
```
