          <h4>My name is Justice Gooch</h4>
          <p>I am a Software developer and UI designer who graduated from Grand Canyon University in 2024. Since then, I
            have held full-time and contract positions for multiple companies outlined in the experience section below.
            <br />
            <br />
            My focus when creating applications has been on retaining users. I want users to look at the product I have
            created and think to themselves “Wow! That was a great experience, I can’t wait to use XYZ again!”. </p>
